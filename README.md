# Digit-Recognition
This project implements a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Using gradient descent for optimization, the model is trained to classify digits (0-9) and includes functionality to track the training error and validation error rates over time. The project aims to provide insight into the performance of a gradient descent approach for digit recognition.

# Project Overview
- Dataset: The MNIST dataset, a well-known collection of handwritten digit images, is used for training and testing the model.
- Model Training: The digit recognition model uses gradient descent to adjust weights and minimize classification error. The model iterates over the dataset, refining its accuracy with each pass.
- Error Measurement: Both training error and validation error rates are measured and logged, enabling evaluation of model performance and convergence over time.
- Visualization: Training and error rates are visualized, making it easy to see the modelâ€™s progress and identify potential areas for improvement.
